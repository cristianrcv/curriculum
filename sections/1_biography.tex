\par{
My areas of interest are Distributed Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), and Big Data Analytics (BDA). During my career at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), I have been focused in programming models for distributed platforms, task-based workflows, dataflows, and streaming technologies. I have actively contributed to the design and development of COMPSs, PyCOMPSs, and PMES; mainly using Java and Python.
