%My areas of interest are Distributed Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), and Big Data Analytics (BDA). At Dynatrace, I lead a team focused on processing and aggregating session data for real user monitoring, and developing the next generation storage for behavioural analysis. During my career at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), I actively contributed to the design and development of programming models for distributed platforms, task-based workflows, dataflows, and streaming technologies. And yes, I love JVM-based languages!

I cannot recall the day I became passionate about informatics, but I have always felt that there was something more. The Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) introduced me to the Java world (which I am still very fond of) and allowed me to contribute to the design and development of programming models for Distributed Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), and Big Data Analytics (BDA). However, Dynatrace has provided me with the opportunity to pursue my true passion through a combination of people management and product delivery. I will never stop learning, but so far I am growing as a leader who values communication, respect, honesty, fairness, and effort above all.
