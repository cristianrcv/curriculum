\par{
My areas of interest are Distributed Computing, High Performance Computing (HPC), and Big Data Analytics (BDA). At Dynatrace, I focus on processing and aggregating session data for real user monitoring. However, during my career at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), I have actively contributed to the design and development of programming models for distributed platforms, task-based workflows, dataflows, and streaming technologies. And yes, I love JVM-based languages!
