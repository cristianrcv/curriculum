        {PhD Student for the Computer Architecture Department (DAC - UPC) working in collaboration with the Workflows and Distributed Computing group (WDC) at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). The thesis was entitled \textit{''Programming Models to support Data Science Workflows''} and the main research lines are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Orchestration of Data Science workflows
            \item Automatic parallelisation of affine loops in Python
            \item Integration with Container technologies (e.g., Docker, Singularity, Mesos)
            \item Distributed execution of Hybrid Workflows composed of Task-based Workflows and Dataflows
            \item Integration of Streaming Technologies (e.g., Kafka) inside COMPSs
        \end{itemize}
